## About the Code

The code is written in Python on a Jupyter Notebook, and it uses the following libraries:

- `pandas`: To form the dataframe and perform operations on them
- `numpy`: To execute mathematical operations on the data
- `sklearn`: To implement the various classification models and their evaluation metrics
- `matplotlib`: To plot the graphs and visualise the data.

Run the jupyter notebook.
