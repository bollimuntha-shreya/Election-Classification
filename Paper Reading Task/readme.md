# A Survey of Computational Framing Analysis Approaches

This paper provides an in-depth survey of various computational methods used in framing analysis.Framing analysis is a vital tool for understanding how media, politicians, and other stakeholders shape public opinion by selectively presenting information. 


  ## Summary

   The paper highlights several computational framing analysis approaches, including:

  
  * **Supervised Learning Techniques**: These methods involve the use of labeled datasets to train models that can automatically detect frames in text or media content. Common approaches include Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes, and Deep Learning models.

  * **Unsupervised Learning Techniques**: These methods identify frames without labeled data by clustering and topic modeling. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are popular unsupervised methods.

  * **Lexicon-Based Approaches**: Lexicon-based methods utilize dictionaries of framing-related words to identify frames in text. This approach can be effective but may be limited by the comprehensiveness of the lexicon.

  * **Network Analysis**: This approach examines the relationships between actors and topics in communication networks to identify frames and their diffusion patterns.
  
  * **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques**: These techniques help to extract and analyze the underlying structure of sentences, enabling better understanding of how frames are constructed.

  It also emphasizes the importance of considering linguistic and contextual factors, such as keywords, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling, to understand the framing of news articles effectively. The study also explores the challenges of computational framing analysis, including subjectivity and the need for human-annotated datasets for training and evaluation.

## Areas for Improvement

* The paper mainly focused on methodological design and quality in terms of capturing and examining frames and framing devices. They did not focus and report on the accuracy of the modelsâ€™ performance. A quantitative insight would help enhance the qualitative perspective.

* **Handling Multimodal Data**: Modern media includes text, images, audio, and video. Enhancing the methods to analyze multimodal data would offer a more comprehensive framing analysis.

* **Domain Adaptation**: Elections 2024 may involve specific terminology and framing nuances related to politics. Fine-tuning existing models or creating domain-specific lexicons could improve accuracy.

* **Detecting Misinformation and Polarization**: Extend the framing analysis methods to detect and quantify misinformation and polarization in election-related discourse. By identifying and countering misleading narratives, the project can contribute to a more informed and balanced public discourse. Further detecting sarcasm and irony is crucial in framing analysis as they can significantly alter the intended meaning of a message.


## Election 2024

To enhance the outcomes of the Elections 2024 project, we can leverage computational framing analysis methods in the following ways:

* **Sentiment Analysis with Framing**: Combining sentiment analysis with framing analysis can help us understand the emotional tone associated with different frames. This can reveal how certain frames evoke specific emotional responses in the electorate. This can also help in understanding how the media's portrayal of candidates or issues influences public sentiment, and how sentiment changes in response to major events or debates.

* **Identifying Misinformation Frames**: By applying supervised learning techniques to classify frames in media content, we can detect instances of misinformation framing, enabling fact-checking efforts.By identifying and countering misleading narratives, the project can contribute to a more informed and balanced public discourse.

* **Framing Analysis of Social Media Data**: Analyzing social media conversations using NLP and network analysis can help identify dominant frames, influential actors, and the spread of frames within the digital sphere.

* **Real-time Framing Analysis**: Develop a web-based dashboard that automatically analyzes news articles, social media posts, and other relevant content related to the 2024 elections. The dashboard can highlight dominant narratives, compare different media sources, and track how framing evolves over time.

* **Predicting Voter Behavior**: Use framing analysis to explore the potential impact of media narratives on voter behavior. By correlating framing with polling data, the project can assess how media influences electoral outcomes and identify key factors that sway public opinion.



Some of **project ideas** related to Elections 2024 are stated below.

* **Election Event Detection**: Implement a system that automatically detects critical election events (e.g., debates, scandals) and tracks how frames change in response to these events.
* **Debunking Misinformation**: To create an AI powered system designed to automatically detect and respond to social media posts that contain misinformation frames with accurate and fact-checked information. Its purpose is to combat the spread of false or misleading narratives by quickly providing corrective information to users. 
* **Predicting Frame Popularity**: Develop a model that predicts the popularity of frames in the public discourse, helping strategists understand which frames are resonating with the electorate.


This paper provides valuable insights into the methods used for framing analysis. By leveraging these approaches and making improvements in certain areas, we can gain a deeper understanding of how political communication influences public perception. Implementing these project ideas that integrate framing analysis into various aspects of the campaign can lead to more effective communication strategies and informed decision-making for political actors and voters alike.
